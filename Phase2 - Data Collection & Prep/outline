1. Find data sources:
Human Mortality Database (www.mortality.org) – CSV downloads by country, year, age.
"The Human Mortality Database (HMD) is the world's leading scientific data resource on mortality in developed countries. The HMD provides detailed high-quality harmonized mortality 
and population estimates to researchers, students, journalists, policy analysts, and others interested in human longevity. The HMD follows open data principles."
Considering U.S. mortality data is often times most accurate and influential, I decided to choose U.S. mortality with room for extensions to other countries' data.
HMD mortality data from the US Census Bureau can be found in (https://www.mortality.org/Country/Country?cntr=USA).
Explanatory notes of data used can be found in (https://www.mortality.org/Data/ExplanatoryNotes).


2. Clean & organize data:
Ensure necessary columns are present in data: Year, Age, Gender, Population, Deaths.
Save CSV for SQL import.

Data provided from the HMD are given in the following formats of age and time:
  * 1x1 (by age1 and year)
  * 1x5 (by age1 and 5-year time interval)
  * 1x10 (by age1 and 10-year time interval)
  * 5x1 (by 5-year2 age group and year)
  * 5x5 (by 5-year2 age group and 5-year time interval)
  * 5x10 (by 5-year2 age group and 10-year time interval)

To gain the most granular, standard for period life tables I decided to choose 1x1 (single year of age x year) as the source of truth for this project.
If the project calls for a different year period, it is always possible to aggregate it up to any 5-year age or multi-year period.
However, if I had decided to start coarser (1x5, 5x1, etc), this would throw away detail that cannot be recovered.

Ready to run python script, build_usa_age_gender_pop_deaths.py
The following file reads USAdeath.txt and USApop.txt, keeps single-year age (AgeInterval=1) and single-year period (YearInterval=1), drops UNK/TOT, 
aggregates deaths across Lexis shapes, and joins to population by Year–Age–Sex. 
Column names and formats follow the HMD InputDB spec for deaths and population files.

Example usage: python3 build_usa_year_age_gender_pop_deaths.py --input ./InputDB --out ./data/usa_year_age_gender.csv
