The HMD mortality data for years 2010-2023 are preliminary as the US Census Bureau has yet to revise its inter-censal (2010-2019) population estimates using the results of the 2020 Population census. We will update the HMD data series as soon as the US Census Bureau has released new inter-censal estimates. We will also have access to more detailed mortality data for 2023 and revised post-censal July 1st population estimates for 2020-2024 by then.
