Report on Gender Differences in Life Expectancy and Mortality Patterns
1. Life Expectancy Trends (e0_by_decade.csv)
  Analysis of average life expectancy at birth (avg_e0) by decade shows that females consistently outlive males in every recorded period from the 1930s to 2020s.
In the early decades (1930–1950), the gap was relatively small (e.g., only 0.059 years in 1930, 0.603 years in 1950). From the 1960s onward, the difference widened sharply, 
peaking in the 1980s at 7.088 years. Since then, the gap has narrowed somewhat, falling to around 5.43 years in 2020. This pattern reflects improvements in male longevity over 
recent decades, but females still maintain a notable advantage.

Decade	Female e₀	Male e₀	Gap (Female–Male)
1930	4.758	4.699	0.059
1960	72.764	66.627	6.137
1980	78.600	71.512	7.088
2020	80.611	75.181	5.430

2. Age-Specific Mortality Differences (gender_mortality_comparison.csv)
  The mx_diff values (male mortality rate minus female mortality rate) reveal the gender mortality gap is most pronounced at very old ages. The top 10 largest average differences occur 
from ages 87 to 96, with male mortality rates exceeding female rates by about 0.038–0.046 (i.e., 3.8–4.6 percentage points). This indicates that although both sexes experience high 
mortality at advanced ages, men’s risk remains significantly higher.
At younger ages, the mortality difference exists but is smaller, except in infancy (not shown in top 10), where male infants also historically had higher mortality.

Age	Avg Male–Female Mortality Difference
91	0.0464
92	0.0454
96	0.0449
95	0.0445
93	0.0443
90	0.0434
89	0.0410
94	0.0408
88	0.0407
87	0.0386

3. Summary
Overall: Women have higher life expectancy in every decade, with the gap peaking in the 1980s and somewhat narrowing in recent decades.
By age: The gender mortality gap is largest at advanced ages (87+), though male disadvantage is also evident in infancy.

Implications: Persistent male–female mortality differences may be linked to a combination of biological, behavioral, and social factors, and they have important implications 
for health policy, retirement planning, and actuarial forecasting.
