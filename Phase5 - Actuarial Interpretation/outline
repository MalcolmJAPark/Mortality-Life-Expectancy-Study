Based on csv files and xlsx files created, report:
* Which gender has higher life expectancy, and how has the gap changed over time.
* Changes in mortality for specific age groups (e.g., infant mortality, elderly).
* Implications for insurance pricing, pension liabilities, and healthcare planning.
* Seasonality (using USAbirthmonth.txt and monthly death counts, look at seasonal mortality spikes e.g., flue in winter, heatwaves in summer)
* Retirement age adequacy (compare survival probabilities at retirement ages e.g., 62, 65, 67 now vs. 50 years ago - informs Social Security and pension sustainability).
* Insurance underwriting refinement (derive select and ultimate mortality tables by re-basing survivorship to different entry ages - useful for term life and annuity products).
