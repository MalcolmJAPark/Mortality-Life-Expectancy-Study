1. Infant Mortality (AgeGroupStart = 0)
In the 1930s, infant mortality averaged around 1.6–1.8% annually, but over the decades, rates steadily declined (presumably due to improvements in healthcare, nutrition, and sanitation).
By the 2000s–2020s, infant mortality fell to below 0.5%, representing one of the most dramatic long-term mortality improvements in the dataset.

2. Elderly Mortality (AgeGroupStart = 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90)
Mortality rates for elderly groups are much higher than for infants, increasing sharply with age.
For example, in 1959:
* Age 65 group mortality ≈ 3.2%
* Age 80 group mortality ≈ 12.1%
While overall elderly mortality has declined slightly over time, the drop is less noticeable than for infant mortality, and rates remain high at advanced ages due to natural 
aging limits.

3. Overall Patterns
* Infant mortality shows a steep, sustained decline across decades.
* Elderly mortality shows a modest decline but still increases exponentially with age.
* These trends reflect medical progress and demographic aging: more people are surviving childhood, but advanced-age mortality remains a major driver of life expectancy limits.
